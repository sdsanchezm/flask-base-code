# Working with flask
## Experimental .md file as well, lol

This is a crud application using **flask** and additional *django project* will be created.
You can even [clone it, and see what I'm doing](http://github.com/sdsanchezm/flask-base-code)

### Instructions tu run the application:
Taken from:[the flask quick start site](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#quickstart)

Create a new virtualenv called env1:
$ virtualenv env1

Activate your virtual env (inside the Script folder):
$ source ./activate 

Install flask:
$ pip3 install flask

Export the environmental variable in order to run flask (using the python we server):
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py

Run flask:
$ run flask

Or could use python as well:
$ python.exe app.py #this is in windows, in linux should be python app.py, it shall open in localhost:5000
